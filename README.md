# Singly Linked List Operations in Java

This repository contains simple Java implementations of basic operations on a singly linked list. These programs are useful for understanding how linked lists work under the hood and are ideal for beginner-level data structures practice.

## Files Included

### 1. `InsertatBeginningDeleteatEndandDisplay.java`
This program implements the following operations on a singly linked list:
- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node at the start of the list.
- **Delete at End**: Removes the last node from the list.
- **Display**: Prints the elements of the linked list.

This simulates a **stack-queue hybrid behavior** where insertions are LIFO (stack-style) and deletions are FIFO (queue-style).

### 2. `InsertBeginningDeleteBeginning.java`
This program supports:
- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node at the front.
- **Delete at Beginning**: Removes the first node from the list.

This simulates a **pure stack-like behavior** with both insertions and deletions happening at the beginning.

## Usage
- Compile using `javac FileName.java`
- Run using `java FileName`
- Youâ€™ll be prompted in the console to choose operations interactively.
